## Description

The **libft** project is a fundamental project at 42school that requires students to create a custom C library containing various standard C library functions, as well as additional functions that can be useful for future projects.

The library includes functions that are typically found in the `string.h`, `ctype.h`, and `stdlib.h` header files, such as string manipulation functions like `strlen`, `strcpy`, and `strcat`, as well as memory allocation functions like `malloc`, `calloc`, and `realloc`. In addition, the library also contains more advanced functions such as linked list manipulation functions (`ft_lstnew`, `ft_lstadd_back`, `ft_lstiter`, etc.) and functions to manipulate characters (`ft_isalpha`, `ft_isdigit`, `ft_isprint`, etc.).

All of the functions in the **libft** library have been designed and optimized to be efficient and reliable. They have been thoroughly tested to ensure they work correctly in various scenarios.

The **libft** library is an essential tool for future projects at 42school, as it provides a comprehensive set of functions that students can use and build upon in their own code. To use the **libft** library in your projects, simply include the appropriate header files and link to the library in your Makefile.

## Usage

``make`` without bonus functions.

``make bonus`` to compile with bonuses.
